# The overview of the awesome causality dataset 

The overview is about the decription of causality dataset, which is widely applied in causality relevant tasks, such as the semEval challenges.

## SemEval series
	SemEval (Semantic Evaluation) is an ongoing series of evaluations of computational semantic analysis systems; it evolved 
	from the Senseval word sense evaluation series. Started from SemEval-2007 to SemEval-2020. ---Wikipedia
	
### Dataset-1 (SemEval-2010 Task 8: Multi-Way Classification of Semantic Relations Between Pairs of Nominals.)
The relations from the dataset are classified into 10 categories:
Cause-effect, Component-whole, Entity-destination, Entity-origin, Product-producer, Member-collection, Message-topic, Content-container, Instrument-agency, Other

**Example**:

	Sentence: ”The current view is that the chronic <e1>inflammation</e1> in the distal part of the stomach caused by 
	Helicobacter pylori <e2>infection</e2> results in an increased acid production from the non-infected upper corpus 
	region of the stomach.”
	Cause-Effect (e2,e1)
